# InTheGame

IOS (Swift) app which includes a series of mini-games with varying difficulties where the user can score points as they win the different games. This was the final assignment of the module Application Programming (IOS) at Pontifical University of Salamanca (Spain).

Firstly, the app has a home screen whose purpose is to register/login for a user, if the player is registered it will show an alert that prevents registration and can continue with the points they had previously, if they are not yet registered, it will create a new user with the points set to 0.
Secondly (once logged in), you will find a screen showing the three available games and their difficulty. In addition, the user's general scoreboard will be displayed, where it is possible to consult the number of points obtained.

### Available games
- Where's Wally?
- Hangman
- Tower of Hanoi
